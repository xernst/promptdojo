# Free-form text is not data

The first time you ask Claude to "extract the user's email from this
support ticket," it returns *exactly* what you wanted: `maya@promptdojo.dev`.
The second time, it returns `Sure! The email is maya@promptdojo.dev.`. The
third time, `The email address you're looking for is maya@promptdojo.dev`.

Three different shapes. Your downstream code expected a string. Now it
either has to regex-extract the email out of natural language every
time, or fail.

This is why every production AI feature — without exception — uses
**structured output**: you tell the model *exactly* what JSON shape
to return, and you validate the response when it comes back.

The pattern AI ships every time:

```python
import anthropic
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Ticket(BaseModel):
    email: str
    severity: int          # 1-5
    summary: str

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=512,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Extract from: <ticket text>"}],
)

raw = response.content[0].text
ticket = Ticket.model_validate_json(raw)   # parse + validate in one call
print(ticket.email)
```

Three pieces. The schema (the `BaseModel` class), the prompt (asking for
JSON), and the validation step (`model_validate_json`). All three matter.
Skip the schema and you're back to regex-on-natural-language. Skip the
validation and you'll find out about the model's hallucinated field at
3am from a NoneType error in production.

> **Browser note:** Pydantic loads in Pyodide via `micropip.install("pydantic")`,
> but for fast feedback we use plain `dict` validation in these drills. Same
> logic, spelled out, so you can read and write the pattern by hand.
> Switching to `BaseModel` later is a two-line change.

## Where AI specifically gets this wrong

- **Trusting the model on first try.** Models lie. They drop required
  fields, return strings where you wanted ints, and invent enum values
  you never defined. Validate every response.
- **Forgetting `response_format` / tool use.** On OpenAI, the modern
  canonical way is **Structured Outputs**:
  `response_format={"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...}}` —
  the API guarantees the response conforms to your schema. The older
  `{"type": "json_object"}` mode only guarantees valid JSON, not your
  shape. On Anthropic you typically use a tool definition (or the newer
  `output_format` parameter). Without one, the model wraps its JSON in
  prose.
- **Catching `ValidationError` too broadly.** When Pydantic rejects a
  response, you usually want to retry with the error message back to
  the model — not silently fall through.

Run the editor. We extract a name and validate the shape by hand.
